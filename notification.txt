There are essentially four things left to do
1       Find an appropriate s_nom starting value
2       Constrain Nuclear Power to a minimal capacity per plant
3       Implement the global CO2 limit correctly
4       Estimate an appropriate value for Hydro exppansion in the renewable scenarios

Then different weather datasets can be analysed, each dataset in a single run and one run with all queued
